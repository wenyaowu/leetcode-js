/**
 * There's an undirected connected graph with n nodes labeled 1..n. 
 * But some of the edges has been broken disconnecting the graph. 
 * Find the minimum cost to repair the edges so that all the nodes are once again 
 * accessible from each other.

Input:

n, an int representing the total number of nodes.
edges, a list of integer pair representing the nodes connected by an edge.
edgesToRepair, a list where each element is a triplet representing the pair of nodes 
between which an edge is currently broken and the cost of repearing that edge, 
respectively (e.g. [1, 2, 12] means to repear an edge between nodes 1 and 2, 
the cost would be 12).
Example 1:

Input: n = 5, edges = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [1, 5]], 
edgesToRepair = [[1, 2, 12], [3, 4, 30], [1, 5, 8]]
Output: 20
Explanation:
There are 3 connected components due to broken edges: [1], [2, 3] and [4, 5].
We can connect these components into a single component by repearing the edges 
between nodes 1 and 2, and nodes 1 and 5 at a minimum cost 12 + 8 = 20.
Example 2:

Input: n = 6, edges = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [4, 5], [3, 5], [1, 6], [2, 4]], 
edgesToRepair = [[1, 6, 410], [2, 4, 800]]
Output: 410
Example 3:

Input: n = 6, edges = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [4, 5], [5, 6], [1, 5], [2, 4], [3, 4]], 
edgesToRepair = [[1, 5, 110], [2, 4, 84], [3, 4, 79]]
Output: 79
